# Next Steps for Shelly Bulk Control

The Shelly Bulk Control project has successfully implemented core features including Device Discovery, Device Grouping, Group Operations, Device Capabilities, Parameter Mapping, and API Service. Building on these foundations, here are the recommended next steps:

## 1. Parameter Management Implementation (In Progress)

The parameter management system is now partially implemented with the following features:
- ✅ Parameter mapping between Gen1 and Gen2+ devices
- ✅ Standardized parameter names across all device generations
- ✅ Capability refresh and automatic discovery
- ✅ Parameter support checking across device types
- ✅ Parameter reboot functionality with `--reboot` flag
- ✅ Optimized device discovery for parameter operations
- ✅ Fixed RPC method for Gen2 devices (Sys.SetConfig)

Next steps for parameter management:
- ✅ Implement automatic device restart after parameter changes when needed
- ✅ Develop CLI commands for setting parameters on groups of devices
- Create helper commands for common parameter operations

## 2. API Development (Implemented)

The RESTful API has been successfully implemented with the following features:

- ✅ Comprehensive API endpoints for all core functionality:
  - Device discovery and management
  - Device configuration and operations
  - Group creation and management
  - Parameter management and application
  - System status and control

- ✅ API service infrastructure:
  - Configurable API server
  - Multi-platform deployment options (standalone, Docker, system service)
  - Structured response format
  - Error handling

- ✅ Client libraries and utilities:
  - Python client library for API integration
  - Test client script for all API operations
  - Integration examples

Future API enhancements:
- Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Add versioning support for future compatibility
- Add WebSocket support for real-time updates
- Create interactive API documentation with Swagger UI
- Implement rate limiting and other security features

## 3. Web User Interface Development

Develop a modern, responsive web interface using React and Vite:

- Create a dashboard for device and group status visualization
- Build interfaces for device discovery and management
- Implement group creation and configuration screens
- Design intuitive controls for group operations
- Add real-time updates and notifications

## 4. Desktop Application

Create a cross-platform desktop application:

- Integrate the React SPA frontend into an Electron container
- Add system tray integration and native notifications
- Implement offline capabilities and synchronization
- Provide automatic updates and installation wizards
- Create platform-specific optimizations for Windows, macOS, and Linux

## 5. Rules Engine

Implement a simple rules system for device automation:

- Create a rule definition interface with conditions and actions
- Support triggering group operations based on device states
- Example: "If device X reports temperature > 30°C, then turn on all fans in group Y"
- Allow complex condition chaining (AND/OR logic)
- Enable scheduling rules to run at specific times or intervals

## 6. Scheduled Operations

Add support for time-based scheduling of operations:

- Create a scheduler for one-time and recurring operations
- Allow scheduling operations on specific days of the week
- Support cron-like syntax for advanced scheduling
- Implement timezone awareness for global deployments
- Add calendar visualization of scheduled operations

## 7. Notification System

Develop a comprehensive notification system:

- Implement alerts for failed operations and critical events
- Support multiple notification channels (email, SMS, push, webhook)
- Create configurable notification policies per user/group
- Allow custom messages and severity levels
- Implement notification history and acknowledgment tracking

## 8. Advanced Discovery Integration

Enhance device discovery with intelligent features:

- Auto-group devices based on discovery results (by type, location, etc.)
- Periodically verify group membership against discovered devices
- Implement network-aware scanning for multi-subnet environments
- Add support for device location mapping and visualization
- Create automatic device labeling and categorization

## 9. Expanded Operation Types

Extend the operation types supported by the system:

- Add support for more complex operations beyond simple on/off/toggle
- Implement device-specific operations like color control for RGB devices
- Create operation profiles for common scenarios
- Support multi-step operation sequences
- Add conditional branching in operation flows

## 10. Parameter System Enhancements

Further enhance the parameter management system:

- **Add more parameter definitions**: Expand support for other device parameters beyond eco_mode and max_power
  - Support for MQTT configuration parameters
  - Support for network configuration parameters
  - Support for security parameters (auth, cloud connectivity)
  - Support for sensor thresholds and calibration

- **Improve error handling**: Enhance error messages when parameters aren't supported by specific device models
  - Clear messages explaining compatibility issues
  - Suggestions for alternative parameters when available
  - Device-specific guidance for unsupported operations

- **Create example scripts**: Add more examples showcasing the new features, especially for complex parameter management across device groups
  - Bulk configuration of devices by type
  - Migrating configurations between device generations
  - Automated device provisioning workflows

- **Automated testing**: Develop more automated tests for the parameter service to ensure it handles different device generations correctly
  - Comprehensive test coverage for all parameter types
  - Mock testing for API responses
  - Integration tests with real device responses

## Current Progress and Next Focus

With the API Service now implemented, the project has reached a major milestone in providing a programmable interface for Shelly device management. Key achievements include:

- A comprehensive REST API with endpoints for all core functionality
- Multiple deployment options (standalone, Docker, system service)
- A Python client library for API integration
- Detailed API documentation

The immediate next steps are:

1. **Web UI Development**:
   - Begin development of the React-based web interface
   - Implement basic device and group management screens
   - Create a dashboard for device status visualization

2. **API Security Enhancements**:
   - Add authentication mechanisms
   - Implement user management
   - Add rate limiting

3. **Real-time Updates**:
   - Add WebSocket support for live device status updates
   - Implement event system for device state changes

These enhancements will build upon the solid foundation provided by the API service, moving the project toward a full-featured enterprise-grade management system for Shelly devices.
