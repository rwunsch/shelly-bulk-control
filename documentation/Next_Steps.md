# Next Steps for Shelly Bulk Control

The Shelly Bulk Control project has successfully implemented core features including Device Discovery, Device Grouping, Group Operations, and Device Capabilities. Building on these foundations, here are the recommended next steps:

## 1. Parameter Management Integration (Primary Objective)

The next primary objective is to implement robust parameter management across device groups:

- Develop a unified parameter management interface for all device types
- Create commands to read and write parameters across device groups
- Implement bulk parameter operations with validation and error handling
- Integrate with Device Capabilities to ensure parameter compatibility
- Provide mechanisms for synchronized configuration across different device models

## 2. API Development

Build a RESTful API to enable integration with other systems:

- Design comprehensive API endpoints for all functionality
- Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Create detailed API documentation and SDK libraries
- Support both device-specific and group-based operations
- Add versioning support for future compatibility

## 3. Web User Interface Development

Develop a modern, responsive web interface using React and Vite:

- Create a dashboard for device and group status visualization
- Build interfaces for device discovery and management
- Implement group creation and configuration screens
- Design intuitive controls for group operations
- Add real-time updates and notifications

## 4. Desktop Application

Create a cross-platform desktop application:

- Integrate the React SPA frontend into an Electron container
- Add system tray integration and native notifications
- Implement offline capabilities and synchronization
- Provide automatic updates and installation wizards
- Create platform-specific optimizations for Windows, macOS, and Linux

## 5. Rules Engine

Implement a simple rules system for device automation:

- Create a rule definition interface with conditions and actions
- Support triggering group operations based on device states
- Example: "If device X reports temperature > 30Â°C, then turn on all fans in group Y"
- Allow complex condition chaining (AND/OR logic)
- Enable scheduling rules to run at specific times or intervals

## 6. Scheduled Operations

Add support for time-based scheduling of operations:

- Create a scheduler for one-time and recurring operations
- Allow scheduling operations on specific days of the week
- Support cron-like syntax for advanced scheduling
- Implement timezone awareness for global deployments
- Add calendar visualization of scheduled operations

## 7. Notification System

Develop a comprehensive notification system:

- Implement alerts for failed operations and critical events
- Support multiple notification channels (email, SMS, push, webhook)
- Create configurable notification policies per user/group
- Allow custom messages and severity levels
- Implement notification history and acknowledgment tracking

## 8. Advanced Discovery Integration

Enhance device discovery with intelligent features:

- Auto-group devices based on discovery results (by type, location, etc.)
- Periodically verify group membership against discovered devices
- Implement network-aware scanning for multi-subnet environments
- Add support for device location mapping and visualization
- Create automatic device labeling and categorization

## 9. Expanded Operation Types

Extend the operation types supported by the system:

- Add support for more complex operations beyond simple on/off/toggle
- Implement device-specific operations like color control for RGB devices
- Create operation profiles for common scenarios
- Support multi-step operation sequences
- Add conditional branching in operation flows

## Getting Started

The recommended immediate focus is on Parameter Management Integration, as it builds upon the Group Operations and Device Capabilities systems while providing essential functionality for bulk device management. Following that, API and Web UI development will create the foundation for more advanced features.
