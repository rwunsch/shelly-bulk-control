# Next Steps for Shelly Bulk Control

Based on the comprehensive test suite we've implemented for the device grouping functionality, here are the recommended next steps for the Shelly Bulk Control project:

## 1. Group Operations Implementation

The most valuable immediate enhancement would be implementing operations that can be performed on device groups:

### 1.1 Group Command Interface

Create a `GroupCommandService` class that can:

- Turn on/off all devices in a group
- Toggle state for all devices in a group
- Set brightness/color for all lights in a group
- Reboot all devices in a group
- Check for and apply firmware updates to all devices in a group

```python
# Example implementation structure:
class GroupCommandService:
    def __init__(self, group_manager: GroupManager):
        self.group_manager = group_manager
        self.discovery_service = DiscoveryService()
        
    async def turn_on_group(self, group_name: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Turn on all devices in the specified group."""
        results = {}
        group = self.group_manager.get_group(group_name)
        if not group:
            raise ValueError(f"Group '{group_name}' not found")
            
        for device_id in group.device_ids:
            # Find device by ID and send turn on command
            results[device_id] = await self.send_command(device_id, "turn_on")
            
        return results
    
    # Similar methods for other operations
```

### 1.2 CLI Interface for Group Operations

Extend the CLI interface to support group operations:

```
# Example command structure
shelly-bulk-control groups operate <group_name> --action <action> [--parameters k1=v1,k2=v2]
```

Examples:
- `shelly-bulk-control groups operate living_room --action turn_on`
- `shelly-bulk-control groups operate all_lights --action set_brightness --parameters brightness=50`

## Getting Started

The recommended next task is to implement the `GroupCommandService` class and extend the CLI interface to support basic group operations like turning devices on and off.
